## 💫 About Me
Hey there! 👋 I'm Ahmed Taha, an automation focused software engineer. 

I like building automations tools and sharing tech knowledge.  

I learn by doing and I look up information as I go. 🔭

I’m currently working on Searchable-Screenshots, A desktop app to search your screenshots folder semanstically.

I’m generally interested in AI integrations and automation, Web Development (to minimize friction for the user), and Computer Graphics.

Find my socials bellow. 📫

Why do I do what I do? Because no one else would.
