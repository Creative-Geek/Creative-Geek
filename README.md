## 💫 About Me
Hey there! 👋 I'm Ahmed Taha, a Software Engineer, Graphics Designer, and Video Editor.  

I like building automations tools and sharing tech knowledge.  

I learn by doing and look up information as I go.

I’m currently working on Searchable Screenshots, A desktop app to search your screenshots folder semanstically.<br> I’m generally interested in web development, computer graphics, and AI integrations.<br>📫 Find my socials bellow.

Why do I do what I do? Because no one else would.
