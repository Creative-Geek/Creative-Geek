## 💫 About Me
Hey there! 👋 I'm Ahmed Taha, a Software Engineer, Graphics Designer, and Video Editor.  

I'm super passionate about building automations tools and sharing knowledge.  

I learn by doing and look up information as I go.

🔭 I’m currently working on Expensi, A quick-shot expenses tracker.<br>👀 I’m generally interested in web development, computer graphics, and AI integrations.<br>📫 Find my socials bellow.

Why do I do what I do? Because no one else would.
